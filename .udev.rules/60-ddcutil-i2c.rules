# Sample rules to grant RW access to /dev/i2c devices.

# This sample file can be modified and copied to /etc/udev/rules.d.  If file
# /etc/udev/rules.d/60-ddcutil-i2c.rules exists, it overrides a file with the
# same name in /usr/lib/udev/rules.d, which is created by ddcutil installation.
# This can be useful in cases where the usual rules do not work as needed, or
# during development.

# The usual case, using TAG+="uaccess":  If a /dev/i2c device is associated
# with a video adapter, grant the current user access to it.
# SUBSYSTEM=="i2c-dev", KERNEL=="i2c-[0-9]*", ATTRS{class}=="0x030000", TAG+="uaccess"

# Assigns i2c devices to group i2c, and gives that group RW access.
# Individual users must then be assigned to group i2c.
# On some distributions, installing package i2c-tools creates this rule.
# (For example, on Ubuntu, see 40-i2c-tools.rules.)
# KERNEL=="i2c-[0-9]*", GROUP="i2c", MODE="0660"
KERNEL=="i2c-[0-9]*", GROUP="i2c", MODE="0666"

# Gives everyone RW access to the /dev/i2c devices:
# KERNEL=="i2c-[0-9]*",  MODE="0666"
